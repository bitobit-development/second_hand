---

## ✅ Screen Reader Support

### Semantic HTML
- [x] All components use semantic HTML5 elements
- [x] Buttons use `<button>` (not `<div>`)
- [x] Headings use proper hierarchy (`<h3>` for card titles)
- [x] Lists use `<ul>` and `<li>` where appropriate

### ARIA Labels
- [x] All icon-only buttons have `aria-label`
- [x] Decorative icons marked with `aria-hidden="true"`
- [x] Status indicators have descriptive labels
- [x] Loading states announce via `aria-live`

### Text Alternatives
- [x] Icons have text equivalents via `aria-label`
- [x] Confidence badges explain meaning (not just percentage)
- [x] Selection states clearly communicated

### Dynamic Content
- [x] Loading states use `aria-live="polite"`
- [x] Collapsible sections use `aria-expanded`
- [x] Selected states use `aria-pressed`
- [x] Hidden content marked with `aria-hidden`

---

## ✅ Visual Accessibility

### Color Contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI)
- [x] High confidence (green): Text meets 4.5:1 ratio
- [x] Medium confidence (yellow): Text meets 4.5:1 ratio
- [x] Low confidence (red): Text meets 4.5:1 ratio
- [x] Primary text: Meets 4.5:1 against backgrounds
- [x] Muted text: Meets 4.5:1 against backgrounds
- [x] Interactive states have sufficient contrast
- [x] Focus indicators visible against all backgrounds

### Color Independence
- [x] Information not conveyed by color alone
- [x] Confidence levels use icons + percentage + color
- [x] Selected state uses border + background + ring
- [x] Disabled state uses opacity + cursor + text

### Touch Targets
- [x] All interactive elements minimum 44x44px
- [x] Select buttons: Full width, adequate height
- [x] Expand/collapse buttons: Adequate padding
- [x] Category cards: Large tap areas
- [x] Adequate spacing between interactive elements

### Focus Indicators
- [x] All focusable elements have visible focus state
- [x] Focus ring uses `focus-visible:ring-2`
- [x] Focus ring offset prevents overlap
- [x] Focus ring color meets contrast requirements
- [x] Custom focus styles for cards and buttons

---

## ✅ Responsive Design

### Mobile (<640px)
- [x] Single column layout for AI suggestions
- [x] Full-width cards for easy tapping
- [x] Adequate touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
- [x] Confidence badges positioned clearly
- [x] Text remains readable at small sizes
- [x] No horizontal scrolling required

### Tablet (640px-1024px)
- [x] 2-column grid for suggestions
- [x] Responsive spacing adjustments
- [x] Touch targets remain adequate
- [x] All content accessible

### Desktop (>1024px)
- [x] 3-column grid for optimal scanning
- [x] Hover effects enhance interactivity
- [x] Keyboard navigation remains primary
- [x] Content scales appropriately

---

## ✅ Content & Language

### Clear Labels
- [x] All buttons have clear, descriptive text
- [x] "Select This Category" (not just "Select")
- [x] "Why this category?" explains purpose
- [x] "AI Suggested" vs "Manually Selected" clearly labeled

### Error Prevention
- [x] Low confidence warnings shown prominently
- [x] Alert icon + colored background + explanatory text
- [x] Disabled state prevents accidental selection
- [x] Clear feedback on selection

### User Guidance
- [x] Confidence tooltip explains score meanings
- [x] Loading state shows estimated time
- [x] Reasoning sections explain AI decisions
- [x] Manual fallback clearly available

---

## ✅ Animation & Motion

### Reduced Motion
- [x] Animations use Tailwind's default transitions (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- [x] Loading animations optional (can be simplified)
- [x] Smooth transitions don't cause disorientation
- [x] No auto-playing content

### Animation Guidelines
- [x] Transitions under 300ms for state changes
- [x] Pulse animations subtle and non-distracting
- [x] Skeleton loading provides visual feedback
- [x] Expand/collapse animations smooth

---

## ✅ Error Handling

### Low Confidence Warnings
- [x] Visual warning (yellow/red background)
- [x] Icon indicator (AlertTriangle)
- [x] Explanatory text
- [x] Accessible to screen readers

### No Results State
- [x] Clear message when search returns no categories
- [x] Guidance on what to do next
- [x] Maintains focus context

## Testing Procedures

### Keyboard Testing
1. Tab through all interactive elements in order
2. Verify focus indicators are visible
3. Test Enter and Space keys on all buttons/cards
4. Verify no keyboard traps
5. Test with screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA)

### Screen Reader Testing
1. Navigate with screen reader only
2. Verify all content announced correctly
3. Test dynamic state changes
4. Verify ARIA labels are descriptive
5. Test form controls and buttons

### Visual Testing
1. Test in light and dark modes
2. Verify color contrast with tools (e.g., axe DevTools)
3. Test at 200% zoom
4. Test with high contrast mode
5. Test on different screen sizes

### Mobile Testing
1. Test on actual mobile devices
2. Verify touch targets are adequate
3. Test with one-handed use
4. Verify no content overflow
5. Test in portrait and landscape

### Key Achievements
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Complete screen reader support
- Sufficient color contrast (AA level)
- Adequate touch targets
- Clear focus indicators
- Semantic HTML throughout
- No reliance on color alone
- Reduced motion support

### Recommendations for AAA
- Consider increasing color contrast to 7:1 for AAA
- Add skip navigation links if in larger form context
- Provide text size controls if desired
- Consider audio alternatives for visual-only content
