## Bug Fixes Log

### 2025-01-27: Image Upload & AI Category Suggestions
**File**: `2025-01-27-image-upload-category-ai-fixes.md`

**Issues Fixed**:
1. ~~Browse Files button not working~~ (FALSE REPORT - verified working)
2. AI Category Suggestion failing with "Error analyzing image" for valid JPEG files ‚úÖ

**Root Cause**: Image URL format detection bug in `lib/ai/category-suggester.ts`
- Code assumed all non-data-URL images were base64 strings
- Cloudinary URLs (https://...) were being wrapped with `data:image/jpeg;base64,` prefix
- OpenAI Vision API rejected malformed URLs

**Fix**: Added proper URL type detection for three formats:
- Data URLs ‚Üí use as-is
- HTTP/HTTPS URLs ‚Üí use as-is (NEW)
- Base64 strings ‚Üí wrap with data URL prefix

**Impact**: AI category suggestions now work correctly for all uploaded images

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/ai/category-suggester.ts` (lines 42-65)

**Verification**:
- Tested with real iPhone 15 Pro Max JPEG (3024x4032px)
- Result: 90% confidence, correct category ("Kitchen & Dining")
- Screenshot: `.playwright-mcp/fix-verified-real-image-90-confidence.png`

### 2025-01-27: Image Cropping in Upload Preview
**File**: `2025-01-27-image-cropping-upload-preview.md`

**Issue**: Portrait images (3:4 aspect ratio) were being cropped during upload preview, cutting off ~25% from top and bottom

**Root Cause**: CSS layout issue in `components/listings/image-upload.tsx`
- `aspect-square` forced 1:1 aspect ratio container
- `object-cover` cropped images to fill the square
- Portrait photos (3024x4032px) lost 33% of vertical content

**Fix**: Changed preview to use natural portrait ratio:
- `aspect-square` ‚Üí `aspect-[3/4]` (match common smartphone photos)
- `object-cover` ‚Üí `object-contain` (show full image, no cropping)
- Added `bg-muted` for letterboxing

**Design Decision**:
- **Upload Preview**: Show FULL image (`object-contain`) - users see what they're uploading
- **Browse Cards**: Keep uniform squares (`object-cover`) - consistent grid layout
- **Listing Detail**: Native ratios (full product view)

**Impact**: Users now see 100% of uploaded images during preview (was 67% before)

**Files Modified**:
- `components/listings/image-upload.tsx` (lines 249, 258)

**Verification**:
- Tested with iPhone 15 Pro Max photo (3024x4032px)
- Before: Top of bottle and hands cropped out
- After: Full image visible with letterboxing
- Screenshot: `.playwright-mcp/fix-verified-no-cropping-full-image.png`
