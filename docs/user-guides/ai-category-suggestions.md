# AI Category Suggestions - User Guide

## Overview

LOTOSALE uses advanced AI technology to automatically suggest the right category for your listing based on the images you upload. This smart feature saves you time and ensures your items are placed in the most relevant categories where buyers are looking.

## How It Works

### The Images-First Approach

When you create a new listing, we've made the process simpler by starting with images:

```
Traditional Flow:          New AI-Powered Flow:
1. Choose category  →      1. Upload images
2. Upload images    →      2. AI suggests category ✨
3. Add details      →      3. Review/select category
4. Set price        →      4. Add details
5. Add location     →      5. Set price
                           6. Add location
```

### Step-by-Step: Using AI Category Suggestions

#### Step 1: Upload Your Images

1. Click **"Sell an Item"** from anywhere on LOTOSALE
2. You'll land on the listing creation page
3. **Upload 1-10 clear photos** of your item
   - First image becomes the primary listing photo
   - More images = better AI suggestions
   - Accepted formats: JPG, PNG, WEBP

#### Step 2: Wait for AI Analysis

After uploading, our AI:
- Analyzes your images in seconds
- Identifies the product and its features
- Searches our category database
- Ranks the best matches by confidence

You'll see a loading indicator while the AI works its magic.

#### Step 3: Review AI Suggestions

The category selector will show:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✨ AI Suggestions                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ Kitchen Appliances         [95%] ✨  │
│    in Home & Garden                     │
│                                         │
│  ✓ Small Appliances           [75%] ✨  │
│    in Electronics                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Legend:**
- **✨ Sparkles Icon**: AI-powered suggestion
- **[95%]**: Confidence score (0-100%)
- **"in Home & Garden"**: Parent category context

#### Step 4: Choose Your Category

You have three options:

**Option A: Accept AI Suggestion (Recommended for high confidence)**
- Click the top suggestion if confidence is 80%+
- Most accurate for single-item, clear photos

**Option B: Browse Other Suggestions**
- Review 2-3 ranked suggestions
- Lower suggestions may fit better for multi-purpose items

**Option C: Manual Selection**
- Scroll to "All Categories" section
- Search using the search bar
- Pick from recently used or popular categories

#### Step 5: Understand Why (Optional)

Want to know why the AI suggested a category?

1. Look for **"Why this category?"** below the selector
2. Click to expand the reasoning panel
3. See:
   - AI's explanation in plain language
   - Key features identified in your images
   - Visual indicators detected

**Example:**
```
✨ Why this category?

"Electric coffee maker with water reservoir and
control panel visible. Kitchen appliance design
with heating element."

Key Features Identified:
• Water reservoir visible
• Electronic control panel
• Heating element design
• Kitchen appliance form factor
```

## Understanding Confidence Scores

### What They Mean

| Score Range | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **90-100%** | Very High Confidence | ✅ Accept immediately |
| **75-89%**  | High Confidence | ✅ Likely correct, review reasoning |
| **60-74%**  | Moderate Confidence | ⚠️ Check alternatives |
| **40-59%**  | Low Confidence | ⚠️ Manual selection recommended |
| **0-39%**   | Very Low Confidence | ❌ Manual selection required |

### What Affects Confidence?

**Factors that INCREASE confidence:**
- ✅ Clear, well-lit images
- ✅ Single product focus
- ✅ Multiple angles of same item
- ✅ Distinctive product features visible
- ✅ Standard product categories

**Factors that DECREASE confidence:**
- ❌ Blurry or dark photos
- ❌ Multiple different products in one image
- ❌ Unusual or custom items
- ❌ Partial product visibility
- ❌ Heavy image filters/editing

## When to Use Manual Selection

### Low-Confidence Situations

**1. Unique/Custom Items**
```
Example: Hand-crafted wooden sculpture
AI Suggestion: "Wood Furniture" [45%]
Better Choice: Navigate to "Collectibles" → "Art"
```

**2. Multi-Purpose Items**
```
Example: Gaming laptop
AI Suggestions:
- "Laptops" [80%] in Electronics
- "Gaming Gear" [75%] in Sports
Both could work! Choose based on target audience.
```

**3. Partial/Unclear Images**
```
AI Warning: "Image too blurry for accurate classification"
Action Required: Re-take photos OR choose manually
```

**4. Brand-New Categories**
```
Example: Emerging product types
AI may suggest closest match, but you know better!
```

### Manual Selection Tips

1. **Use the Search Bar**
   - Type product type (e.g., "drone", "yoga mat")
   - Searches category names and descriptions

2. **Check Parent Categories**
   - AI shows parent context (e.g., "in Electronics")
   - Navigate the hierarchy if needed

3. **Browse Recently Used**
   - If you sell similar items regularly
   - Faster than searching each time

4. **Explore Popular Categories**
   - High item counts = active buyer traffic
   - Good for generic products

## Tips for Better AI Suggestions

### Photo Quality Matters

**DO:**
- ✅ Take photos in good natural light
- ✅ Use a plain background (white/neutral)
- ✅ Show the entire product
- ✅ Include close-ups of distinctive features
- ✅ Upload 3-5 images from different angles

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use flash that creates glare
- ❌ Photograph with cluttered background
- ❌ Crop out important parts
- ❌ Over-edit with filters
- ❌ Upload blurry or pixelated images

### Image Composition

```
Good Composition:        Poor Composition:
┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
│             │          │  ╔═══╗      │
│   ╔═════╗   │          │  ║   ║   ☁  │
│   ║ITEM ║   │          │  ║ ? ║  ☁☁  │
│   ║     ║   │          │  ╚═══╝ ☁    │
│   ╚═════╝   │          │     ╔═══╗   │
│             │          │     ║ ? ║   │
└─────────────┘          └─────╚═══╝───┘
Centered, clear          Multiple items,
single product           cluttered
```

### Optimal Upload Strategy

1. **Primary Image**: Front view, full product, best quality
2. **Supporting Images**:
   - Side/back views
   - Close-ups of brand labels
   - Packaging (if new/sealed)
   - Product in use (optional)
   - Size reference (next to common object)

## Troubleshooting

### "No suggestions available"

**Possible Causes:**
- Images didn't upload properly
- AI service temporarily unavailable
- Image format not supported

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Re-upload images
3. Try different image format (JPG recommended)
4. Use manual category selection
5. Contact support if issue persists

### "Low confidence across all suggestions"

**What it means:**
- AI couldn't confidently classify your item
- Multiple possible matches

**What to do:**
1. Review reasoning for each suggestion
2. Consider if images could be clearer
3. Choose the best-matching parent category
4. Use search to find specific subcategory

### Suggestions seem wrong

**Check these first:**
1. **Did you upload the right images?**
   - Sometimes wrong files get selected

2. **Is the product visible?**
   - Ensure it's not mostly packaging/box

3. **Multiple products in frame?**
   - AI focuses on most prominent item
   - Try cropping to single product

4. **Is it a niche/custom item?**
   - AI trained on common products
   - Manual selection may work better

### AI keeps suggesting same wrong category

**This is feedback we want!**

1. Ignore the suggestion and select correct category
2. Your manual selection helps improve AI
3. Admin team reviews patterns monthly
4. Future users will get better suggestions
